### this is the readme file to describe complexes_in_pathway.html
### The big circle is my whole collection of proteins in complexes inside different pathways.
### the graph is interactive means if you move your mouse cursor on each bubble the name of the gene and a number shows up.
The number represent how many times that specific 
gene is differetially expressed in a big dataset with more than 1000 deletions.

### there are protein complexes with different number of subunits.
### the name of the genes, complexes, and pathways are made up names. ;-)
### the input file is in jason format in this folder.
